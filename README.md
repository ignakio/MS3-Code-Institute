[FeedMe](https://ms3-feedme.herokuapp.com/) was designed, built, and deployed, by myself, Ignacio Cladera Crespo as the third project for the Code Institute Full Stack Web Development diploma. The purpose of FeedMe is to be a recipe website that allows members to view FeedMe recipes, as well as add and share recipes of the users own liking.

# Deployment

## How to run this project locally

To run this project on your own IDE follow the instructions below:

Ensure you have the following tools: 
    - An IDE such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

The following **must be installed** on your machine:
    - [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
    - [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    - [Git](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03)

### Instructions
1. Save a copy of the github repository located at https://github.com/PillowFishSticks/MP3-FeedMe by clicking the "download zip" button at 
   the top of the page and extracting the zip file to your chosen folder. If you have Git installed on your system, you can clone the 
   repository with the following command.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/PillowFishSticks/MP3-FeedMe
    ```

2. Open your preferred IDE, open a terminal session in the unzip folder or cd to the correct location.

3. A virtual environment is recommended for the Python interpreter, I recommend using Pythons built in virtual environment. Enter the command:
    ```
    python -m .venv venv
    ```  
_NOTE: The `python` part of this command and the ones in other steps below assumes you are working with a windows operating system. 
Your Python command may differ, such as `python3` or `py`_

4. Activate the .venv with the command:
    ```
    .venv\Scripts\activate 
    ```
_Again this **command may differ depending on your operating system**, please check the [Python Documentation on virtual environments](
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for further instructions._

5. If needed, Upgrade pip locally with
    ```
    pip install --upgrade pip.
    ```

6. Install all required modules with the command 
    ```
    pip -r requirements.txt.
    ```

7. Set up the following environment variables within your IDE. 

    - If using VSCode, locate the `settings.json` file within the .vscode directory and add your environment variables as below. 
      Do not forget to restart your machine to activate your environment variables or your code will not be able to see them: 

    ```json
    "terminal.integrated.env.windows": {
        "HOSTNAME": "<enter hostname here>",
        "DEV": "1",
        "IP": "<your IP>",
        "MONGO_DBNAME": "<your database name on MongoDB>",
        "MONGO_URI": "<your URI to your MongoDB database>",
        "PORT": "<your port>",
        "SECRET_KEY": "<your secret key>" 
    }
    ```

    - If using an IDE that includes a `bashrc` file, open this file and enter all the environment variables listed above using the 
      following format: 
    ```
    HOSTNAME="<enter key here>"
    ```
    - `HOSTNAME` should be the local address for the site when running within your own IDE.
    - `DEV` environment variable is set only within the development environment, it does not exist in the deployed version, making it 
      possible to have different settings for the two environments. For example setting DEBUG to True only when working in development 
      and not on the deployed site.

8. If you have restarted your machine to activate your environment variables, do not forget to reactivate your virtual environment with 
   the command used at step 4.

9. You can now run the program locally with the following command: 
    ```
    python3 app.py
    ```

## Heroku Deployment

To deploy the FeedMe website to heroku, take the following steps:

1. Create a `requirements.txt` file using the terminal command `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

2. Create a `Procfile` with the terminal command `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`.

3. `git add` and `git commit` the new requirements and Procfile and then `git push` the project to GitHub.

4. Create a new app on the [Heroku website](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) by clicking the "New" button in your dashboard. 
   Give it a name and set the region to whichever is applicable for your location.

5. From the heroku dashboard of your newly created application, click on "Deploy" > "Deployment method" and select GitHub.

6. Confirm the linking of the heroku app to the correct GitHub repository.

7. In the heroku dashboard for the application, click on "Settings" > "Reveal Config Vars".

8. Set the following config vars:

| Key | Value |
--- | ---
IP | `<your IP>`
MONGO_DBNAME | `<your database name on MongoDB>`
MONGO_URI | `<your URI to your MongoDB database>`
PORT | `<your port>`
SECRET_KEY | `<your secret key>`

9. In your heroku dashboard, click "Deploy". Scroll down to "Manual Deploy", select the master branch then click "Deploy Branch".

10. Once the build is complete, click the "View app" button provided.

12. Your heroku site should run as expected.
