                        <li>4 pork chops, about 1-inch thick and 6 to 7 ounces each, see notes</li>
                        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
                        <li>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
                        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                        <li>1 cup low-sodium chicken stock</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
                        <li>2 teaspoons honey or brown sugar</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                    <h4 class="text-uppercase pr-5">Directions</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Take the pork chops out of the refrigerator and season on both sides with salt and pepper â€”
                            we use just
                            less than 1/4 teaspoon of fine salt per pork chop. Set the chops aside to rest for 30
                            minutes.</li>
                        <li>Meanwhile, make the spice rub. In a small bowl, mix the flour, chili powder, garlic powder,
                            onion powder,
                            and smoked paprika. After 30 minutes, use a paper towel to pat the pork chops dry then rub
                            both sides of
                            the chops with the spice rub.</li>
                        <li>Heat the oil in a medium skillet (with lid) over medium-high heat. As soon as the oil is hot
                            and looks
                            shimmery, add the pork. Cook until golden, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Flip the pork so that the seared side is facing up. (If there is a fattier side of the pork,
                            use kitchen
                            tongs to hold the chops, fat-side-down until it sizzles and browns slightly; about 30
                            seconds.) Reduce the
                            heat to low then cover the skillet with a lid. Cook 6 to 12 minutes or until an instant-read
                            thermometer
                            reads 145 degrees F when inserted into the thickest part of the chop. (Since cook time
                            depends on the
                            thickness of the chops, check for doneness at 5 minutes then go from there, checking every 2
                            minutes). If
                            you do not have a thermometer, you will know they are done, if when cutting into the chops,
                            the juices run
                            clear.</li>
                        <li>Transfer pork chops to a plate then cover loosely with aluminum foil. Let the pork rest for
                            5 minutes.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Notes</h3>
                    <p class="pb-5 notes">While the pork rests, make the pan sauce. Increase the heat to medium-high
                        then add the
                        chicken stock, vinegar, and honey. Use a wooden spoon to scrape the bottom of the pan so that
                        any stuck bits
                        of pork come up. Bring to a simmer and cook until reduced by half. Taste then adjust the
                        seasoning with salt,
                        more vinegar or honey. Slide the skillet off of the heat and when the sauce is no longer
                        simmering, swirl in
                        the butter. Slide the pork chops back into the pan and spoon some of the sauce on top.
                        Alternatively, slice
                        the chops then place back into the pan.</p>
